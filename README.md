### Hello! My name is Anthony Bronca! 👋 

I am a natural jack-of-trades. I have an innate curosity for learning new things, whether it be technologies, out door activities, or some sort of hobby.
I enjoy being able to help people, and often volunteer or work towards being a mentoring position.

Currently, I am working with App Academy as an instructional assistant, where I get to teach students how to program!

As a full-stack developer, I am comfortable working in both front-end and back-end projects. I tend to learn towards front-end, as I love the challenges
and creativity that come with working on user-facing technologies. My main technologies are Javascript/Typescript, but I am also comfortable working in Python.

Feel free to connect with me on Github, or follow me on LinkedIn! For inquires on any of my current/past projects, feel free to send me a direct message through LinkedIn and I will make sure to get back to you as soon as possible! Thank you for visitng my GitHub 😄
